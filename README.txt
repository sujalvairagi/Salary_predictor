This project predicts the expected salary (CTC) of job applicants using machine learning.
It uses real-world HR data and applies a Linear Regression model after thorough data cleaning, encoding, and scaling.

The goal is to assist companies in making unbiased, data-driven salary offers based on candidate profiles.
The model achieved a high RÂ² score of 0.99, showing strong prediction capability.
Visualizations and preprocessing steps are included to explain how the model works clearly and transparently.
